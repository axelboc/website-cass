# Cassandra Frances

**Development in progress - https://cassfrances.netlify.com/**

**Portfolio website** of [Cassandra Frances](https://twitter.com/CassandraFrance), a Young Adult fiction writer from Melbourne, Australia.

- The site is built with [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) :heart:, a "modern static site generator based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) ecosystem." The pages are served as static HTML, but React takes over and provides enhanced navigation when JavaScript is available.
- The site is hosted on Netlify and set up for continuous deployment.
- The book covers are from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).
- The idea for the book sliding effect comes from a [Codrops demo](https://tympanus.net/Development/BookPreview/).
