**Portfolio website** of [Cassandra Frances](https://twitter.com/CassandraFrance), a Young Adult fiction writer from Melbourne, Australia - http://cassfrances.com/

- Built with [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) :heart:, a "modern static site generator based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) ecosystem." The pages are served as static HTML, but React takes over and provides enhanced navigation when JavaScript is available.
- Hosted on Netlify and set up for continuous deployment.
- Book covers are from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).
- Idea for book sliding effect was found on [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/Development/BookPreview/).
