This is for writers who are looking for **thoughtful, objective feedback** to
take their book to the next level.

Whether you’re on your first or tenth draft, interested in indie publishing or
agent querying, I’ll assess your manuscript and provide a detailed **editorial
letter** outlining its strengths and weaknesses and suggesting improvements.

The typical assessment report is about 500 words for every 10,000 words of your
manuscript.
