I am an Australian writer living in France. I take a lot of inspiration from
Melbourne, where I spent 12 years, as well as from country Victoria where I grew
up.

I’ve always been a **storyteller of some sort**. I started out in theatre as a
kid, (my greatest role was a weasel in _Wind in the Willows_). Now I write about
ghosts, creepy sisters, what happens ‘out there,’ what we won’t talk about, and
bad love with some good kissing.

My stories are about the darker side of life that exists on the edge of reality
and sometimes outside of it. I have collected books like these that I love on
{<Link href="/nyctophilia">Nyctophilia</Link>}, my little **night garden of dark
and creepy books**. Maybe you’ll find something you’ll like too.

In 2017, I was a **PitchWars** ‘mentee’ and participated in their online
mentoring program. I found my agent, Hillary Jacobson at ICM Partners, through
this program.

I was also a mentor for

challenging work!

Finally, I’m an

Award for best illustrated book or graphic novel.
