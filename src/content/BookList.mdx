<Book
  title="Fairytales for Wilde Girls"
  author="Allyse Near"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/fairytales-for-wilde-girls.jpg"
  spineColour="#272b35"
>

Described on the back as &ldquo;bubblegum gothic&rdquo;, the prose sings to you &mdash; vicious, bloody and glittery.

Even after reading I felt like the world had changed.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Sufficient Grace"
  author="Amy Espeseth"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/sufficient-grace.jpg"
  spineColour="#332A26"
>

Deceptively simple tale that sucks you in. Told in the first person by a young girl living in a strict christian community, from the very first page you know you are in  a totally different world.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Sea Hearts"
  author="Margo Lanagan"
  coverSrc="/covers/271/seahearts.jpg"
  spineColour="black"
>

Well, basically anything by Margo Lanagan. Her work is part dream, part nightmare, and all of it is amazing. She is one of Australia’s greatest writers.

</Book>


<Book
  title="A Certain Slant of Light"
  author="Laura Whitcomb"
  coverSrc="/covers/292/a-certain-slant-of-light.jpg"
  spineColour="#121A1A"
>

A dreamlike take on ghost stories and possession. I never knew books could be like this.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children"
  author="Ransom Riggs"
  coverSrc="/covers/292/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children.jpg"
  spineColour="#31302E"
>

I was working in a café when a customer lent me this book; that’s how badly she wanted me to read it and how much she knew I would love it. Don’t worry I gave it back to her sans dog ears and jam and butter smears.

</Book>

<Book
  title="We have always lived in the Castle"
  author="Shirley Jackson"
  coverSrc="/covers/257/we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle.jpg"
  spineColour="#010101"
>

 This book doesn’t seem to have the renown of _The Lottery_ or _The Haunting of Hill House_, but I think it’s Jackson’s best. Mary Katherine will draw you into her madness and have you nodding along with her and her dark machinations.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Cuckoo Song"
  author="Frances Hardinge"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/cuckoo-song.jpg"
  spineColour="#020202"
>

Why are there not more stories from a Changeling’s point of view?

</Book>

<Book
  title="The Sandman"
  author="Neil Gaiman"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/the-sandman.jpg"
  spineColour="#020202"
>

The Sandman comics are famous, so perhaps I don’t need to say too much about them. Every time I read them, I find something new to amaze me.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Black Spring"
  author="Alison Crogon"
  coverSrc="/covers/284/black-spring.jpg"
  spineColour="#22120D"
>

A fantastic reimagining of _Wuthering Heights_. I’ve written a guest post about it on The Book Wars.

The character of Lina fascinates me, as much as I find her abhorrent and fearful.

</Book>

<Book
  title="The Night Circus"
  author="Erin Morgenstern"
  coverSrc="/covers/284/the-night-circus.jpg"
  spineColour="#070707"
>

If you didn’t like this book I am not sure that we can be friends; that’s how strongly I feel about it. Once you’ve been drawn into the world, it stays with you long after you’ve finished reading it.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Ophelia and the Marvellous Boy"
  author="Karen Foxlee"
  coverSrc="/covers/284/ophelia-and-the-marvellous-boy.jpg"
  spineColour="#212c3f"
>

An unusual retelling of the _Snow Queen_. A children’s book that is readable at any age.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Undine"
  author="Penni Russon"
  coverSrc="/covers/257/undine.jpg"
  spineColour="#181824"
>

Dreamy&mdash;makes Tasmania feel like a mystical island worthy of Shakespeare’s _Prospero_!

I’ve met Penni; she let me touch her on the arm. Also she was my tutor for a couple of subjects. She’s an amazing writer and a great teacher.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Daughter of Smoke and Bone"
  author="Laini Taylor"
  coverSrc="/covers/271/daughter-of-smoke-and-bone.jpg"
  spineColour="#010101"
>

Funny, dark, self-aware. Epic world building. If this book was a meal it would be a rich medieval feast!

</Book>

<Book
  title="American Gods"
  author="Neil Gaiman"
  coverSrc="/covers/271/american-gods.jpg"
  spineColour="#081920"
>

I suspect this book is closer to reality than even Mr Gaiman believes.

</Book>

<Book
  title="A Monster Calls"
  author="Patrick Ness"
  coverSrc="/covers/233/a-monster-calls.jpg"
  spineColour="#081621"
>

Heartbreaking, and an escape from the real world as well as an embrace of it. More books need such beautiful illustrations.

I don’t think I’ve ever physically cried while reading a book, except for _A Monster Calls_.

</Book>

<Book
  title="This is Shyness"
  author="Leanne Hall"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/this-is-shyness.jpg"
  spineColour="#1D1814"
>

Such a crazy new world that feels so familiar. There’s a reason it won _The Text Prize_!

</Book>

<Book
  title="Coraline"
  author="Neil Gaiman"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/coraline.jpg"
  spineColour="#040000"
>

Creepy children and even creepier mothers is what gives me life.

</Book>

<Book
  title="Love"
  author="Angela Carter"
  coverSrc="/covers/277/love.jpg"
  spineColour="#AD0172"
>

So much to love in such a tiny book. Carter is one of my favourite writers. I have to credit her with reviving my love of gothic.

</Book>
