Described on the back as &ldquo;bubblegum gothic&rdquo;, the prose sings to you &mdash; vicious, bloody and glittery.

Even after reading I felt like the world had changed.

Deceptively simple tale that sucks you in. Told in the first person by a young girl living in a strict christian community, from the very first page you know you are in  a totally different world.

Well, basically anything by Margo Lanagan. Her work is part dream, part nightmare, and all of it is amazing. She is one of Australia’s greatest writers.

A dreamlike take on ghost stories and possession. I never knew books could be like this.

I was working in a café when a customer lent me this book; that’s how badly she wanted me to read it and how much she knew I would love it. Don’t worry I gave it back to her sans dog ears and jam and butter smears.

<Book
  title="We have always lived in the Castle"
  author="Shirley Jackson"

  coverSrc="/covers/257/we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle.jpg"
  spineColour="#010101"

 This book doesn’t seem to have the renown of _The Lottery_ or _The Haunting of Hill House_, but I think it’s Jackson’s best. Mary Katherine will draw you into her madness and have you nodding along with her and her dark machinations.

Why are there not more stories from a Changeling’s point of view?

The Sandman comics are famous, so perhaps I don’t need to say too much about them. Every time I read them, I find something new to amaze me.

A fantastic reimagining of _Wuthering Heights_. I’ve written a guest post about it on The Book Wars.

The character of Lina fascinates me, as much as I find her abhorrent and fearful.

If you didn’t like this book I am not sure that we can be friends; that’s how strongly I feel about it. Once you’ve been drawn into the world, it stays with you long after you’ve finished reading it.

An unusual retelling of the _Snow Queen_. A children’s book that is readable at any age.

Dreamy&mdash;makes Tasmania feel like a mystical island worthy of Shakespeare’s _Prospero_!

I’ve met Penni; she let me touch her on the arm. Also she was my tutor for a couple of subjects. She’s an amazing writer and a great teacher.

Funny, dark, self-aware. Epic world building. If this book was a meal it would be a rich medieval feast!

I suspect this book is closer to reality than even Mr Gaiman believes.

Heartbreaking, and an escape from the real world as well as an embrace of it. More books need such beautiful illustrations.

I don’t think I’ve ever physically cried while reading a book, except for _A Monster Calls_.

Such a crazy new world that feels so familiar. There’s a reason it won _The Text Prize_!

Creepy children and even creepier mothers is what gives me life.

So much to love in such a tiny book. Carter is one of my favourite writers. I have to credit her with reviving my love of gothic.
