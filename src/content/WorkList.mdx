<Work title="Author Mentor Match">
  <Content isHalfHalf image="author-mentor-match">

April 2018 was my first time being an [Author Mentor Match](http://authormentormatch.com/) mentor, a fantastic mentorship program created by Alexa Donne. I was privileged to read so many new writers’ work, and I’m happy to report that **my mentee has found representation**!

It’s great to see there are some really exciting voices in YA. I hope to be part of the program for some time.

<Work title="Short story">

My short story, [_Administration_](http://www.softcopy.org.au/2018/01/administration.html), was published on [**Softcopy**](http://www.softcopy.org.au/2018/01/administration.html), an online journal of contemporary writing by emerging Australian writers. It’s a **creative response** to the advancement we’ve made in infant heart transplants. Give it a read!

<Work title="Pitch Wars">
  <Content isImageRight image="pitch-wars">

[Pitch Wars](https://pitchwars.org/) is a **mentorship program** that pairs unpublished writers with experienced authors. I entered my manuscript in July 2017 and it was a long month waiting to find out that a mentor had picked it. They announced the successful entrants **on the day of my wedding**, so the reality didn’t sink in for a few days.

After two months of revisions came the agent showcase. I was up at 6 AM every morning to check my emails, as requests from US agents would come during the night in Australia. One of the requests I received was from **Hillary Jacobson** at ICM Partners. She was exactly what I was looking for in an agent: editorially minded, savvy and personable, so I was excited to sign with her.

That’s my brief _‘how I got my agent’_ story. Want to know more about my experience with Pitch Wars? [Just ask!](https://cassandrafrances.typeform.com/to/lBY1UF)

<Work title="Workshop with Nova Ren Suma">
  <Content isImageRight image="djerassi">

In June 2017, I was incredibly privileged to be part of the [Djerassi Artists Residency Program](https://djerassi.org/)’s Young Adult Novel Writing workshop with American author [Nova Ren Suma](https://novaren.com/).

Every day, myself and nine other writers sat down together to write and **workshop each other’s manuscripts**. You should meet some of these amazing writers and check out their books and what they are up to: Alison Cherry, Leigh Shadko, Randy Ribay, Rachel Lynn Solomon, Imani Josey, Nora Revenaugh, Kim Graff, Tamara Mahmood Hayes and
Sara Ingle. I also saw my first weasel, gopher, skunk and rattlesnake, so that was kind of exciting!

I received a **development grant** from the [Australia Council](https://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/) to help pay for the costs, since the workshop took place near **San Francisco**.

Are you going to apply to the next one? You should. Feel free to hit me up with any questions about it or about grants in Australia.

<Work title="Glenfern fellowship">
  <Content image="glenfern">

In 2016, I was awarded the Grace Marion Wilson [Glenfern Fellowship](https://writersvictoria.org.au/support/fellowships/glenfern-fellowships) through Writers Victoria. The fellowship is awarded annually to emerging writers.

The fellowship offered three months of **unfettered writing time** in the historic and beautiful **Glenfern House**, during which I worked on my young adult fiction manuscript _The House of Skin and Ash_. It was a brilliant experience as I was part of an exciting community of other writers.

<Work title="How Cold the Northern Lights">
  <Content isHalfHalf isImageRight image="northern-lights">

Short fiction, **runner-up** in the **Grace Marion Wilson award** for Emerging Writers.

_How Cold the Northern Lights_ was inspired by the time I spent in **Greenland** and backpacking through Europe, and how it can be a surprisingly isolating experience trying to connect with others.

It was **published** in the October 2011 edition of [The Victorian Writer](https://writersvictoria.org.au/resources/the-victorian-writer).

<Work title="anti-THESIS">
  <Content isHalfHalf image="anti-thesis">

_Antithesis_ is a **contemporary arts journal** that showcases fiction, peer-reviewed essays and other non-fiction. It has been published annually at The University of Melbourne since 1987 and is the oldest graduate-run journal in Australia.

 I was the **Art and Fiction Editor** for the 2014/15 edition _Wake_. I also produced promotional artwork, such as the image opposite. I was the <abbr title="Master of Ceremonies">MC</abbr> for our symposium, with a range of speakers, such as Kimberly Moulten from Bunjilaka at Melbourne Museum, anaesthetist Dr Vanita Bodhankar, and Father Bob Maguire.

<Work title="Listening in Thin Places">
  <Content isHalfHalf isImageRight image="thin-places-4">

This self-published comic featured **interconnected stories** about _Thin Places_, and about my time in Iceland and Greenland looking for something but never finding it. Like liminal spaces, thin places don’t always feel quite real and are qualitatively different from ordinary, everyday places. They are places we travel to, to feel outside of ourselves, and that inspire awe.

Each story features a **story within a story**: _The mermaids of Myrvatn lake_, for instance, is about the disappearance of the rare moss balls that are only found there, but also of myths&mdash;in this case, the selkie.

<Work title="The Final Flight of the Morrigan">
  <Content image="morrigan-3">

My self-published **graphic narrative** about the **last act of an aging Goddess of War**. The image opposite is one of the completed pages and below are some roughs from individual panels. I worked with a combination of watercolour and ink, and I also used human models.

I produced this comic for my Graphic Narratives class at The University of Melbourne. The Morrigan has aged and is living in one of the rougher towns of Ireland, missing her glory days when people went to war under her banner. When a man is killed in a violent fight in her neighbourhood, he asks her to **perform her duty one last time** by taking him to heaven, as was her purpose when she was a young goddess.

I’ve long been fascinated by the idea of what happens to gods when we no longer believe in them. How do our relationships with myths and their characters change with time?
