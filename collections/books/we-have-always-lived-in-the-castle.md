Another book I wrote about in my thesis. This book doesn’t seem to have the renown as Jackson’s The Lottery, or The Haunting of Hill House does, but I think it’s her best.

There’s something <abbr title="Not Quite Right">NQR</abbr> about the narrator Mary Katherine. She’ll draw you into her madness and have you nodding along with her and her dark machinations.
