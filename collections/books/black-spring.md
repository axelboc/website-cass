I saw the cover of this book in my local Dymocks and had to pick it up. It’s a fantastic reimagining of Wuthering Heights. I’ve written a [guest post about it on The Book Wars](https://thebookwars.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/guest-post-by-cassandra-white-alison-croggons-black-spring-a-reimagining-of-wuthering-heights/).

The character of Lina fascinates me, as much as I find her abhorrent and fearful. I loved this book so much that I wrote about it in my thesis!
