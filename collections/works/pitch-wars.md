[Pitch Wars](https://pitchwars.org/) is a **mentorship program** that pairs unpublished writers with experienced authors. I entered my manuscript in July 2017 and it was a long month waiting to find out that a mentor had picked it. They announced the successful entrants **on the day of my wedding**, so the reality didn’t sink in for a few days.

After two months of revisions came the agent showcase. I was up at 6 AM every morning to check my emails, as requests from US agents would come during the night in Australia. One of the requests I received was from **Hillary Jacobson** at ICM Partners. She was exactly what I was looking for in an agent: editorially minded, savvy and personable, so I was excited to sign with her.

That’s my brief _‘how I got my agent’_ story. Want to know more about my experience with Pitch Wars? [Just ask!](https://cassandrafrances.typeform.com/to/lBY1UF)
