I wrote a [guest post](http://thebookwars.ca/2015/10/guest-post-by-cassandra-white-alison-croggons-black-spring-a-reimagining-of-wuthering-heights/) for  [The Book Wars](http://thebookwars.ca/) about Alison Croggon’s wonderful _Black Spring_. **The Book Wars** is a website dedicated to promoting different perspectives in children’s and young adult writing. It has author interviews, essays and book reviews.
