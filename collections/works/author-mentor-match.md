April 2018 was my first time being an [Author Mentor Match](http://authormentormatch.com/) mentor, a fantastic mentorship program created by Alexa Donne. I was privileged to read so many new writers’ work, and I’m happy to report that **my mentee has found representation**!

It’s great to see there are some really exciting voices in YA. I hope to be part of the program for some time.
