Short fiction, **runner-up** in the **Grace Marion Wilson award** for Emerging Writers.

_How Cold the Northern Lights_ was inspired by the time I spent in **Greenland** and backpacking through Europe, and how it can be a surprisingly isolating experience trying to connect with others.

It was **published** in the October 2011 edition of [The Victorian Writer](https://writersvictoria.org.au/resources/the-victorian-writer).
