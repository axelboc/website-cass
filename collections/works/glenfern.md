In 2016, I was awarded the Grace Marion Wilson Glenfern Fellowship for emerging writers through Writers Victoria.

The fellowship offered three months of unfettered writing time in the historic and beautiful Glenfern House. During the fellowship I worked on my YA manuscript and got to be part of an exciting community of other writers.
