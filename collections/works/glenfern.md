In 2016, I was awarded the Grace Marion Wilson [Glenfern Fellowship](https://writersvictoria.org.au/support/fellowships/glenfern-fellowships) through Writers Victoria. The fellowship is awarded annually to emerging writers.

The fellowship offered three months of **unfettered writing time** in the historic and beautiful **Glenfern House**, during which I worked on my Young Adult fiction manuscript _The House of Skin and Ash_. It was a brilliant experience as I was part of an exciting community of other writers.
