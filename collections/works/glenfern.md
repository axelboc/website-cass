In 2016, I was awarded the Grace Marion Wilson [Glenfern Fellowship](https://writersvictoria.org.au/support/fellowships/glenfern-fellowships) for emerging writers through Writers Victoria.

The fellowship offered three months of unfettered writing time in the historic and beautiful Glenfern House. During the fellowship, I worked on my YA manuscript and got to be part of an exciting community of other writers.
