_Antithesis_ is a **contemporary arts journal** that showcases fiction, peer-reviewed essays and other non-fiction. It has been published annually at The University of Melbourne since 1987 and is the oldest graduate-run journal in Australia.

 I was the **Art and Fiction Editor** for the 2014/15 edition _Wake_. I also produced promotional artwork, such as the image opposite. I was the <abbr title="Master of Ceremonies">MC</abbr> for our symposium, with a range of speakers, such as Kimberly Moulten from Bunjilaka at Melbourne Museum, anaesthetist Dr Vanita Bodhankar, and Father Bob Maguire.
