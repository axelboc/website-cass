In June 2017, I was incredibly privileged to be part of the [Djerassi Artists Residency Program](http://djerassi.org/)’s Young Adult Novel Writing workshop with American author [Nova Ren Suma](https://novaren.com/).

Every day, myself and nine other writers sat down together to write and **workshop each other’s manuscripts**. You should meet some of these amazing writers and check out their books and what they are up to: Alison Cherry, Leigh Shadko, Randy Ribay, Rachel Lynn Solomon, Imani Josey, Nora Revenaugh, Kim Graff, Tamara Mahmood Hayes and
Sara Ingle. I also saw my first weasel, gopher, skunk and rattlesnake, so that was kind of exciting!

I received a **development grant** from the [Australia Council](http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/) to help pay for the costs, since the workshop took place near **San Francisco**.

Are you going to apply to the next one? You should. Feel free to hit me up with any questions about it or about grants in Australia.
