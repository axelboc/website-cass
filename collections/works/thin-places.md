This self-published comic featured **interconnected stories** about _Thin Places_, and about my time in Iceland and Greenland looking for something but never finding it. Like liminal spaces, thin places donâ€™t always feel quite real and are qualitatively different from ordinary, everyday places. They are places we travel to, to feel outside of ourselves, and that inspire awe.

Each story features a **story within a story**: _The mermaids of Myrvatn lake_, for instance, is about the disappearance of the rare moss balls that are only found there, but also of myths&mdash;in this case, the selkie.
