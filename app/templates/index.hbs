			<div class="About_body">
				<p>I am an emerging children’s and young adult fiction writer based in Melbourne, Australia. I’ve always been a storyteller of some sort, I started out in theatre as a kid, (my greatest role was a weasel in Wind in the Willows), I’ve studied Film and Television at RMIT University and worked for a small animation company making some weird little movies.</p>
				<p>I have a Master of Creative Writing, Publishing and Editing from the University of Melbourne, where I graduated with a first class honours average in the first half of 2015.  My bachelor in Psychology (Swinburne University) included a minor in communications, and I specialised in Meta-Fiction and Twentieth Century literature during my time studying at Aalborg University in Denmark. A few people have come up to me and whispered ‘PhD’ which I believe is the drug that all the cool kids are doing these days.</p>
				<p>I tutor Literature and English to VCE students (senior year of high school) at the Melbourne Uni MUSUL summer school. I also taught creative writing workshops for teens. It was amazing to see how excited they are over stories and creating their own.</p>
