I am an emerging writer based in Melbourne, Australia. I’ve always been a storyteller of some sort; I started out in theatre as a kid (my greatest role was a weasel in Wind in the Willows), studied Film and Television at RMIT University and worked for a small animation company making some weird tle movies.

Now I’m a graduate of the Master of Creative Writing, Publishing and Editing program at the University of Melbourne. I like to tell stories about the darker side of life that exists on the edge of reality, and sometimes outside of it.

Melbourne is a UNESCO City of Literature. I take a lot of inspiration from this city, and from country Victoria where I grew up.

I’m also an Aurealis magazine slush pile reader and a judge for the 2016 Aurealis Awards Graphic narratives.
