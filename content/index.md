I write about ghosts, creepy sisters and friends, what happens ‘out there,’ what we won’t talk about, and bad love with some good kissing.

I am an emerging writer based in Melbourne, Australia. I take a lot of inspiration from this city as well as country Victoria where I grew up.

I’ve always been a **storyteller of some sort**. I started out in theatre as a kid, (my greatest role was a weasel in _Wind in the Willows_), studied Film and Television at RMIT University, and worked for a small animation company making some weird little movies.

Now I’m a graduate of the The University of Melbourne’s Master of Creative Writing, Publishing and Editing. I like to tell stories about the darker side of life that exists on the edge of reality... and sometimes outside of it. I have collected books like these that I love on [Nyctophilia](/nyctophilia), my little **night garden of dark and creepy books**.

I’m also an [Aurealis magazine](https://aurealis.com.au/) slush pile reader, and was a judge for the 2016 Aurealis Award for best illustrated book or graphic novel.
