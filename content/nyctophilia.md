> A preference for the night or darkness.

I’ve been cultivating a little garden of dark fiction here for you to enjoy. I am always drawn to books that have some sort of darkness or secrets about them. The bloody fairy tales, the vengeful fairies and the abject dark magic is what gets my blood pumping.

I am also an unashamed champion of Australian YA and supporter of the [#LoveOzYA](http://loveozya.com.au/) movement so you will see a lot of it here. I hope you find something you love or at least something that disturbs you. If you know of a book you think I might love, why not [drop me a line](https://cassandrafrances.typeform.com/to/lBY1UF)?
