“A preference for the night or darkness.” Welcome to my world!

Here is my fangirling about all the books I have been reading lately. I am always drawn to books that have some sort of darkness or secrets about them. The bloody fairy tales, the vengeful fairies and the abject dark magic is what gets my blood pumping. I am also an unashamed champion of Australian YA so you will see a lot of it here.
