Looking for feedback on your first draft or query&nbsp;letter? I can help! I’m a **freelance editor** and **manuscript assessor**.

I have a Master of Creative Writing, Publishing and Editing from the University of Melbourne, and I have worked as a freelance editor, proof reader and manuscript assessor for individuals and companies based in Australia and overseas.

I specialise in **young adult fiction** but I am able to assess adult and middle grade fiction as well.

My preferred genres are the following:

- Gothic
- Literary
- Fantasy, inc. contemporary and urban&nbsp;fantasy
- Magical realism
- Fairy tales revisited
- Dystopian, post-apocalyptic
- Graphic novels
